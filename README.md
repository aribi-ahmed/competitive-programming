# Competitive Programming

Personal repository for my competitive programming training in C++.  
Contains my template, tested algorithm/data structure snippets, and solutions from online judges like Codeforces, AtCoder, CSES, and more.  

This repo documents my journey preparing for ICPC/IOI-level contests and the **JetBrains Fully-Funded Scholarship** competition at Constructor University.  
I‚Äôm currently a student at INSAT and an active member of the ACM club.
