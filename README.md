# Competitive Programming

üìù Personal repository for my competitive programming training in C++.  
Contains my template, tested algorithm/data structure snippets, and solutions from online judges like Codeforces, Hackerrank, CSES, and more.  

This repo documents my journey preparing for ICPC/IOI-level contests and the **JetBrains Fully-Funded Scholarship** competition at Constructor University.  
I‚Äôm currently a student at **INSAT**. It is my first year, Integrated Preparatory Cycle (Math, Physics and Computer Science), I will try my best to advance academically, as well as competitively.
The good thing is that there is **ACM Club @ INSAT** so I can also find people to guide me and support me.

## üìà Progress Tracking
I log every solved problem, mistake, and key insight in [`practice_log.md`](practice_log.md).  
I have also created a Notion course in which I save all the material there.
