# Practice Log

## 2025-08-10
- Participated in: [Codeforces Round 1042 (Div. 3)]([https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1234/A](https://codeforces.com/contest/2131))
- First Problem Solving trial since last year - I tried working with my friend Yazid
- I solved first and second problem, I gave a solution for the third problem but it was not optimal
- I had some support from Google Gemini to optimize the code, it used maps for it.
- I gained +450 and now I'm a **Newbie** YEY! My rank in Tunisia now is 264. Nice, as a first trial.

## Month 1: Review
### **Week 1:**
**- Functions:**
I have worked on some problems to review functions in cpp. All problems are from ICPC Assiut University Community in Codeforces.
I found the problems <a href="https://youkn0wwho.academy/topic-list/functions" target="_blank">here</a>
You will find my solutions at competitive-programming/Month 1/Review/Functions.
**Points to remember in those problems:**
  * Eratosthenes Sieve
  * Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD
  * logarithmic comparison
  * converting from DEC to BIN
**- Arrays:**
I have worked on some problems to review arrays. Sometimes, I noticed there are some more optimal solutions without using arrays (and I was too lazy to use
them, so...). I found the problems, as usual, at [youkn0wwho.academy: Arrays](https://youkn0wwho.academy/topic-list/arrays).
**Points to remember in those problems:**
  * Two Pointer's Technique
  * Generating subsequences and subarrays
  * Multidimensional arrays (2D and maybe 3D)
  * Iterative Fibonacci Sequence
  * Multisets
  * Bubble Sort (I used it but I will be reviewing all sorts soon)
**- Strings:**
I have solved all the problems on youkn0wwho academy in Strings section. They were kinda easy, so I did not save all codes. I only saved the parts I may go
back and check later or I think they might help who is gonna read this later. I will work on some problems from Baltic's Olympiad and Croatia's Olympiad: COCI
they some annoying and nerve-racking problems.
