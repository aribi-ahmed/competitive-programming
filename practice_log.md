# Practice Log

## 2025-08-10
- Participated in: [Codeforces Round 1042 (Div. 3)]([https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1234/A](https://codeforces.com/contest/2131))
- First Problem Solving trial since last year - I tried working with my friend Yazid
- I solved first and second problem, I gave a solution for the third problem but it was not optimal
- I had some support from Google Gemini to optimize the code, it used maps for it.
- I gained +450 and now I'm a **Newbie** YEY! My rank in Tunisia now is 264. Nice, as a first trial.
